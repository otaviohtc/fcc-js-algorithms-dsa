## Learn Introductory JavaScript by Building a Pyramid Generator

Introductory course in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.
Already knew all of this, as I've studied JS before, so this one went smoothly

Practiced the basics: arrays, strings, functions, loops, if/else statements, and etc.
